# Mathematical Function Plotter

## CPSC 210 Personal Project
#### Adrian Pikor (97862742)

My project is going to be a mathematical function plotter.
It would be used by anyone that has a need to visually see
what a function looks like, as well as to calculate certain
values. It would be used by people such as:

- an undergraduate in a math or science course
- a graduate student
- a professional research scientist

This is of interest to me because I am a BCS student
whose prior degree was in physics from SFU. While I am
no longer going down that route, I still have an interest
in math and science, and I have had an interest in coding
my own version of something like Desmos or Mathematica in
terms of their plotting capabilities.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to define and add math
functions to my workspace
- As a user, I want to be able delete a function from my
workspace
- As a user, I want to be able to output the list of
functions in the workspace
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate the output of
a function in the workspace with a particular input
- As a user, I want to be able to save a workspace to a file
- As a user, I want to be able to load a workspace back up
from a file
