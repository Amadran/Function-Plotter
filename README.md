# Mathematical Function Plotter

## CPSC 210 Personal Project
#### Adrian Pikor (97862742)

My project is going to be a mathematical function plotter.
It would be used by anyone that has a need to visually see
what a function looks like, as well as to calculate certain
values. It would be used by people such as:

- an undergraduate in a math or science course
- a graduate student
- a professional research scientist

This is of interest to me because I am a BCS student
whose prior degree was in physics from SFU. While I am
no longer going down that route, I still have an interest
in math and science, and for a while now I have thought
about coding my own version of something like Desmos or
Mathematica in terms of their plotting capabilities.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to define and add a math
function to my workspace
- As a user, I want to be able to create multiple
workspaces
- As a user, I want to be able to rename and delete
workspaces
- As a user, I want to be able to plot the list of
functions in a certain workspace
- As a user, I want to be able to calculate the output of
a function with a particular input
