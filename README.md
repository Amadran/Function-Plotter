# Mathematical Function Plotter

## CPSC 210 Personal Project
#### Adrian Pikor (97862742)

My project is going to be a mathematical function
plotter that could potentially calculate the
derivatives and integrals of certain functions
(depending on if this is too ambitious or not), both
for visualization and calculation purposes. It would 
be used by anyone that has a need to visually see what
a function looks like, as well as its derivative and
indefinite integral, such as:

- an undergraduate in a math or science course
- a graduate student
- a professional research scientist

This is of interest to me because I am a BCS student
whose prior degree was in physics (from SFU). After
graduation I decided that the academic route was not
for me, and at the same time I realized that I enjoy
programming, hence my enrolment into this program.
However, I still have an interest in math and science,
and for a while now I have thought about coding my own
version of something like Desmos or Mathematica in terms
of their plotting capabilities.
